1.Data analytics for smart manufacturing -  I use data analytics to solve the product quality and defects tracking issues in the complex cell and stack manufacturing environment.  A complex thirty-two (32) step MEMs processing technique was being used to fabricate thin membrane cells at SiEnergy Systems, which showed large cell to cell variability. I used data analytics to analyze cell manufacturing data sets for the fault detection and low process variation. In future, I would like to work on the development of self-learning assistance systems, which identify relevant relationships by observation of complex manufacturing processes so that failures, anomalies, and the need for optimization are automatically detected.

2. Development of test data analysis tools – I develop in-situ diagnosis tools to understand physico-chemical processes at the cell and stack level. While employed at SiEnergy Systems, I have developed a novel analysis tool for cell impedance data to elucidate the complex processes inside fuel cells. It was used to identify the rate controlling steps in the cell performance and performance degradation. I used the cell impedance data sets and develop tools for cell diagnostics employing the inverse problem theory. In inverse problems, one tries to get information about an unknown object by using indirect and possibly inaccurate data. I have successfully developed a technique to evaluating the impedance of a cell using a regularization process and identified five stable processes in the SiEnergy’s cells.
